# Sea Level Change Google Earth Engine App

## Overview
This open-access Google Earth Engine (GEE) app allows users to explore historical sea-level changes globally ðŸŒŠ. The app visualizes how sea levels have changed over the past 125,000 years, revealing landscapes that are now submerged but were once exposed and potentially inhabited.

## Features
- **Global Sea-Level Visualization:** Compare sea level and terrain across the globe for different years, up to 125,000 years ago.
- **Data Sources:** Utilizes a widely used sea-level curve, the GEBCO bathymetry/elevation dataset, and Patrick Morrison's QGIS sea-level tool plugin.
- **GIF Creation:** Generate a small GIF showing sea-level change over time for a selected region (text annotation with the year is a planned feature).

## Background
The last major marine transgression occurred only about 4,000â€“10,000 years ago, meaning many landscapes previously used by people are now underwater. For example, the Murujuga region (NW Australia), occupied by Indigenous Australians for over 50,000 years, is now partially submerged.

## Example
Below is a small GIF of the Murujuga region, showing sea-level changes over time:

## How to Use
1. **Open the App:** Access the app via Google Earth Engine (link to be provided).
2. **Select a Year:** Choose a year to visualize global sea levels and terrain.
3. **Create a GIF:** Select a region and generate a GIF to see sea-level changes through time.

## Future Improvements
- Add text annotation with the year to generated GIFs.
