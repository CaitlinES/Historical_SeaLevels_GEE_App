# Sea Level Change Google Earth Engine App

**App:** [Historical Sea-Level Tool App](https://caitlinesmith26.users.earthengine.app/view/historic-sea-level)

## Overview
This is the code to the open-access Google Earth Engine (GEE) app allows users to explore historical sea-level changes globally ðŸŒŠ. The sea-level historically was a lot lower, and lots of now submerged landscapes used to be exposed. I've made an app where you can compare the sea-level and terrain across the globe for different years (up to 125,000 years ago), based on a commonly used sea-level curve and the publicly available GEBCO bathymetry/elevation dataset, and Patrick Morrison's QGIS sea-level tool plugin. 
You can also create a small GIF of the sea-level change across time for a selected region.

Based on [Patrick Morrison's QGIS sea-level tool plugin](https://github.com/patrick-morrison/qgis_sea_level_tool).

## Features
- **Global Sea-Level Visualisation:** Compare sea level and terrain across the globe for different years, up to 125,000 years ago.
- **Data Sources:** Utilises the widely used sea-level curve from [Grant et al. (2012)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11593), the [GEBCO 2023 bathymetry/elevation dataset](https://www.gebco.net/data-products/gridded-bathymetry-data/gebco2023-grid), and 
- **GIF Creation:** Generate a small GIF showing sea-level change over time for a selected region

## Background
The last major marine transgression occurred only about 4,000â€“10,000 years ago, meaning many landscapes previously used by people are now underwater. For many parts of the world, this means that massive amounts of the continental shelf (now submerged) were used by people in the 'recent' past! These underwater landscapes can hold enormous environmental and culture information and attempting to understand their layout is paramount.
Also ~ cool maps ~.

## Example
Below is a small GIF of the Murujuga region, showing sea-level changes over history:
